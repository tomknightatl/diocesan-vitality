        "# Notebook Configuration Parameters\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook is designed to find parish directory URLs on diocesan websites. The first code cell below, labeled \"User-configurable parameters,\" contains all the necessary settings to control its behavior, including API key configurations, GitHub integration, and mocking controls.\n",
        "\n",
        "Please review and configure these parameters before running the notebook.\n",
        "\n",
        "## API Keys & Secrets\n",
        "\n",
        "For features that require external services (like Generative AI or Google Search), you'll need to provide API keys. These should be stored securely using Colab Secrets.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `GENAI_API_KEY`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: This API key is for Google Generative AI (e.g., Gemini models). It's used to analyze web page content and search result snippets to identify potential parish directory links.\n",
        "- **Configuration**:\n",
        "    1. Obtain your GenAI API key from Google AI Studio.\n",
        "    2. In Google Colab, go to \"Secrets\" (key icon in the left sidebar) and add a new secret named `GENAI_API_KEY_USCCB`. Paste your API key as the value.\n",
        "    3. In the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell, uncomment the line `# GENAI_API_KEY = GENAI_API_KEY_FROM_USERDATA` to use the key from Colab Secrets. Alternatively, you can directly assign your key string to `GENAI_API_KEY` in the cell, but using secrets is recommended.\n",
        "- **Default**: `None`. If no key is provided, GenAI-powered analysis will be disabled, and the system will rely on mock/basic analysis.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: Required if you want to use live GenAI analysis. You'll also need to set `use_mock_genai_direct_page = False` and/or `use_mock_genai_snippet = False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `SEARCH_API_KEY` and `SEARCH_CX`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: These are for the Google Custom Search API. This API is used as a fallback mechanism to find parish directory links if direct analysis of the diocesan website doesn't yield clear results. `SEARCH_API_KEY` is your API key, and `SEARCH_CX` is your Programmable Search Engine ID.\n",
        "- **Configuration**:\n",
        "    1. Create a Programmable Search Engine on the Google Control Panel, configured to search diocesan websites. Note the Search Engine ID (`SEARCH_CX`).\n",
        "    2. Obtain your Google Cloud API Key enabled for the Custom Search API.\n",
        "    3. In Colab Secrets, add `SEARCH_API_KEY_USCCB` (with your API key) and `SEARCH_CX_USCCB` (with your Search Engine ID).\n",
        "    4. In the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell, uncomment the lines that assign these secrets to `SEARCH_API_KEY` and `SEARCH_CX`.\n",
        "- **Default**: `None` for both. If not set, the Google Custom Search fallback will be disabled, and the system will rely on mock/basic search.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: Required for the search engine fallback feature. You'll also need to set `use_mock_search_engine = False`.\n",
        "\n",
        "## GitHub Integration\n",
        "\n",
        "These parameters are for integrating with GitHub, allowing the notebook to clone/pull a repository and potentially push changes (like updated data files).\n",
        "\n",
        "### `GITHUB_USERNAME`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Your GitHub username. Used for authenticating when cloning or pushing to a private repository.\n",
        "- **Configuration**:\n",
        "    1. In Colab Secrets, add `GitHubUserforUSCCB` with your GitHub username.\n",
        "    2. In the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell, uncomment the line `# GITHUB_USERNAME = GITHUB_USERNAME_FROM_USERDATA`.\n",
        "- **Default**: `None`. If not set (along with `GITHUB_PAT`), cloning/pulling will attempt to use public access, which might fail for private repositories. Pushing changes will likely fail.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: Works in conjunction with `GITHUB_PAT`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `GITHUB_PAT`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Your GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT). Used for authenticating API requests, such as cloning private repositories or pushing changes.\n",
        "- **Configuration**:\n",
        "    1. Generate a PAT from your GitHub developer settings with appropriate permissions (e.g., `repo` scope for private repository access).\n",
        "    2. In Colab Secrets, add `GitHubPATforUSCCB` with your PAT.\n",
        "    3. In the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell, uncomment the line `# GITHUB_PAT = GITHUB_PAT_FROM_USERDATA`.\n",
        "- **Default**: `None`. If not set (along with `GITHUB_USERNAME`), cloning/pulling will attempt to use public access. Pushing changes will likely fail.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: Works in conjunction with `GITHUB_USERNAME`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `GITHUB_REPO`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: The name of the GitHub repository to clone and interact with (e.g., 'USCCB').\n",
        "- **Configuration**: Set the string value directly in the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell.\n",
        "- **Default**: `'USCCB'`.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: None.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Mocking Controls\n",
        "\n",
        "These boolean flags allow you to run the notebook with mocked (simulated) API responses, which is useful for testing or when API keys are unavailable. Set them to `False` to use live APIs (requires corresponding API keys to be configured).\n",
        "\n",
        "### `use_mock_genai_direct_page`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Controls whether GenAI analysis of links found directly on a webpage uses live API calls or mocked responses.\n",
        "- **Configuration**: Set to `True` for mock, `False` for live.\n",
        "- **Default**: `True`. GenAI analysis for direct page links will be mocked.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: If set to `False`, a valid `GENAI_API_KEY` must be configured.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `use_mock_genai_snippet`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Controls whether GenAI analysis of search result snippets (from Google Custom Search) uses live API calls or mocked responses.\n",
        "- **Configuration**: Set to `True` for mock, `False` for live.\n",
        "- **Default**: `True`. GenAI analysis for search snippets will be mocked.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: If set to `False`, a valid `GENAI_API_KEY` must be configured.\n",
        "\n",
        "### `use_mock_search_engine`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: Controls whether the Google Custom Search fallback uses live API calls or mocked search results.\n",

        "- **Default**: `True`. Google Custom Search calls will be mocked.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: If set to `False`, valid `SEARCH_API_KEY` and `SEARCH_CX` must be configured.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Advanced Settings\n",
        "\n",
        "### `chrome_options`\n",
        "- **Purpose**: These are advanced settings for the Selenium WebDriver (Chrome). They control browser behavior like running headless (without a visible UI).\n",
        "- **Configuration**: Modified directly in the \"User-configurable parameters\" cell.\n",
        "- **Default**: Pre-configured for headless operation, no-sandbox, and other common settings for server environments. It's generally not necessary to change these unless you have specific WebDriver requirements.\n",
        "- **Dependencies**: None."
