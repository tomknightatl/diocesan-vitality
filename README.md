# Diocese Data Project

**🌐 LIVE SYSTEM**: The production system is running at [https://diocesanvitality.org](https://diocesanvitality.org) with real-time data collection and monitoring.

**For local development**: Follow the "Getting Started" and "Environment Setup" sections below to configure your development environment.

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive data collection and analysis system for U.S. Catholic dioceses and parishes. It employs advanced web scraping techniques, AI-powered content analysis, and automated data processing to build and maintain a detailed database of Catholic institutions across the United States. The system collects information from the official conference website and individual diocese websites, including diocese details, parish directories, and detailed parish information.

## Cloud Architecture

The system runs in the cloud using a **two-tier architecture** designed for cost efficiency and scalability:

### 🌐 **Tier 1: Always-On Web Services**
**Deployment**: Single small node (s-1vcpu-2gb) running continuously
- **Frontend**: React dashboard serving the user interface at [diocesanvitality.org](https://diocesanvitality.org)
- **Backend**: FastAPI server providing data APIs and real-time monitoring
- **Database**: Supabase (managed PostgreSQL) for persistent data storage
- **Cost**: Minimal (~$12/month) - runs 24/7 to serve users

### 🚀 **Tier 2: On-Demand Data Collection**
**Deployment**: Dedicated node (s-2vcpu-4gb) that scales from 0→1 when needed
- **Pipeline**: Automated data extraction and processing system
- **Chrome/Selenium**: Headless browser automation for web scraping
- **AI Processing**: Google Gemini integration for content analysis
- **Cost**: Pay-per-use (~$0.02/hour) - only runs when collecting data

### 💡 **Cost-Optimized Design**
- **Always available**: Users can access the dashboard and data anytime
- **Scheduled extraction**: Pipeline runs on-demand or scheduled basis
- **Auto-scaling**: Data collection node scales to 0 when idle (no cost)
- **Resource isolation**: Web services and data collection don't compete for resources

### 🔄 **Operational Flow**
1. **Continuous**: Frontend + Backend serve users on small node
2. **On-demand**: Scale up dedicated node for data collection
3. **Real-time**: Live extraction monitoring via WebSocket dashboard
4. **Auto-shutdown**: Pipeline node scales to 0 after completion
5. **Fresh data**: Updated information available immediately via web interface

## 🚀 CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and deployment:

```
📝 Code → 🔍 Quality → 🧪 Tests → 🏗️ Build → 🎭 Staging → ✅ Smoke Tests → 🚀 Production
```

### Quick Development Workflow
```bash
# Feature development
git checkout -b feature/my-feature
git push origin feature/my-feature  # Triggers quality checks + tests

# Deploy to staging  
git checkout develop
git merge feature/my-feature
git push origin develop  # Auto-deploys to staging

# Deploy to production
git checkout main  
git merge develop
git push origin main  # Requires manual approval
```

### 🛡️ Safety Gates
- ✅ All tests must pass before deployment
- ✅ Staging deployment must succeed before production
- ✅ Manual approval required for production
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments with rollback capability

## How It Works

The Data Extraction Pipeline is a multi-step process that systematically collects and organizes Catholic diocese and parish information from across the United States.

![Data Extraction Pipeline Architecture](./docs/architecture-diagram.svg)

### Pipeline Steps

1. **Extract Dioceses**: Scrapes the official conference website for all U.S. dioceses
2. **Find Parish Directories**: Uses AI to locate parish directory pages on diocese websites
3. **Extract Parishes**: Collects detailed parish information using specialized extractors
4. **Extract Schedules**: Visits individual parish websites to gather mass and service times

## Distributed Pipeline Architecture

**Production Deployment**: The system currently runs a **distributed pipeline** designed for continuous operation and horizontal scaling, which differs from the traditional sequential pipeline described above.

### How the Distributed Pipeline Works

When you see pipeline pods running in Kubernetes, they operate in **distributed mode**:

#### ✅ **Continuous Operation**
- Pods run **indefinitely** (not one-time execution)
- Workers register with a coordination system and process dioceses continuously
- Each worker gets assigned specific dioceses to avoid conflicts
- Workers automatically restart processing when new work becomes available

#### ⚙️ **Modified Pipeline Steps**
The distributed pipeline **skips initial setup steps** and focuses on the core extraction:

1. **Diocese Data**: ~~Extract Dioceses~~ (assumes diocese data already exists in database)
2. **Parish Directories**: ~~Find Parish Directories~~ (assumes directory URLs already discovered)
3. **✅ Parish Extraction**: Workers coordinate to extract parishes from assigned dioceses
4. **📊 Reporting**: Only the "lead" worker generates statistical reports

#### 🔄 **Worker Coordination**
- **Database-backed coordination**: Workers register in `pipeline_workers` table
- **Diocese assignment**: Work is distributed via `diocese_work_assignments` table
- **Conflict prevention**: No two workers process the same diocese simultaneously
- **Automatic failover**: If a worker becomes unresponsive, its work is reassigned
- **Real-time monitoring**: Workers report status to the monitoring dashboard

#### 📈 **Scaling Behavior**
- **HPA (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler)**: Automatically scales from 1-5 workers based on CPU/memory
- **Pod anti-affinity**: Each worker gets its own dedicated node
- **Graceful scaling**: Workers coordinate during scale-up/scale-down events

### When to Use Each Pipeline Mode

| **Traditional Pipeline** | **Distributed Pipeline** |
|--------------------------|---------------------------|
| Initial data collection   | Production continuous operation |
| Complete database setup   | Ongoing data maintenance |
| Single-machine execution  | Kubernetes cluster deployment |
| `python run_pipeline.py`  | Kubernetes pods with `distributed_pipeline_runner.py` |
