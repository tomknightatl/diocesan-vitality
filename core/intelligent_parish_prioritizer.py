"""
Simplified Parish Prioritization System for Schedule Extraction.

This module implements straightforward parish selection for Step 4 (Schedule Extraction)
based on simple, clear prioritization rules:

1. First Priority: Never-tested parishes (respectful_automation_used = false/null)
   - Newer parishes (higher id) visited first
2. Second Priority: Previously tested parishes
   - Most recently tested parishes visited last (older extracted_at first)
