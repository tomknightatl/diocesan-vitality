# ML-Based URL Prediction System

## Overview

The Diocesan Vitality data extraction pipeline includes a sophisticated Machine Learning-based URL prediction system that dramatically improves extraction success rates by learning from historical data and predicting the most likely schedule URLs for each domain.

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ML URL Predictor** (`core/ml_url_predictor.py`)
   - RandomForest classifier with 100 trees
   - TF-IDF vectorization for URL pattern analysis
   - Domain-specific pattern learning
   - Quality-weighted training samples

2. **URL Visit Tracker** (`core/url_visit_tracker.py`)
   - Comprehensive visit result tracking with timestamps
   - Content quality assessment using keyword analysis
   - HTTP response tracking and error classification
   - ML training data collection

3. **Enhanced URL Manager** (`core/enhanced_url_manager.py`)
   - ML prediction integration for URL prioritization
   - Success-based URL memory ("golden URLs")
   - Adaptive timeout management
   - Smart protocol detection

## How the ML Model Works

### Training Data Sources

The model learns from two primary data sources:

#### 1. Successful URLs (Positive Examples)
- **Source**: `ParishData` table
- **Criteria**: URLs that successfully extracted reconciliation/adoration schedules
- **Quality**: High-confidence positive examples
- **Weight**: 1.0 (maximum confidence)

#### 2. Failed URLs (Negative Examples)
- **Source**: `DiscoveredUrls` table with visit tracking
- **Criteria**: URLs that were visited but didn't yield schedule data
- **Quality Levels**:
  - **HTTP Errors** (4xx/5xx): High-confidence negatives (weight: 0.9)
  - **No Relevant Content**: Medium-confidence negatives (weight: 0.7)
  - **Completely Irrelevant**: Lower-confidence negatives (weight: 0.6)

### Feature Extraction

The model analyzes URLs using multiple feature categories:

#### URL Pattern Features
- **High-value terms**: reconciliation, confession, adoration, eucharistic (+5.0 points)
- **Medium-value terms**: mass, times, schedule, worship, liturgy (+3.0 points)
- **General terms**: parish, church, catholic, sacrament (+1.0 points)
- **Negative terms**: contact, about, history, staff, donate (-2.0 points)

#### Structural Features
- URL path depth and complexity
- Domain characteristics and CMS detection
- Protocol patterns (HTTP vs HTTPS)
- File extension analysis

#### Domain-Specific Learning
- Historical success patterns per domain
- CMS-type specific URL structures
- Site complexity scoring
- Previous extraction success rates

### Training Process

#### 1. Data Collection
```python
# Automatic during extraction
with VisitTracker(url, parish_id) as visit_result:
    # Track HTTP response, content quality, extraction success
    # Data automatically stored for ML training
```

#### 2. Model Training
```bash
# Manual training
python train_ml_model.py --verbose

# Automatic training (when model not trained)
# Happens during first Enhanced URL Manager usage
```

#### 3. Quality-Weighted Learning
- **Excellent URLs** (schedule found): Weight 1.0
- **Good URLs** (high relevance): Weight 0.8-1.0
- **Fair URLs** (medium relevance): Weight 0.6-0.8
- **Poor URLs** (low relevance): Weight 0.4-0.6
- **HTTP Errors**: Weight 0.9 (high-confidence negatives)

### Prediction Pipeline

#### 1. URL Generation
```python
# ML-based URL prediction
predictions = ml_predictor.predict_successful_urls(domain)
# Returns: [(url, confidence_score), ...]
```

#### 2. Confidence Scoring
- **ML Model Prediction**: 60% of final score
- **Pattern-Based Confidence**: 40% of final score
- **Domain Profile Boost**: 1.0-1.2x multiplier
- **Success History Boost**: Up to +15.0 points for "golden URLs"

#### 3. Priority Integration
```python
# Enhanced URL Manager integration
candidates = url_manager.get_optimized_url_candidates(context, discovered_urls)
# ML predictions receive 20.0 * confidence priority boost
```

## Training the Model

### Requirements

- **Minimum Data**: 10 URLs (recommended: 50+)
- **Python Dependencies**: scikit-learn, numpy
- **Database Access**: Supabase connection with ParishData and DiscoveredUrls

### Training Methods

#### 1. Using the Training Script (Recommended)

```bash
# Basic training
python train_ml_model.py

# Verbose output with sample data
python train_ml_model.py --verbose

# Force retrain existing model
python train_ml_model.py --retrain

# Custom minimum sample size
python train_ml_model.py --min-samples 20
```

#### 2. Programmatic Training

```python
from core.ml_url_predictor import get_ml_url_predictor
from core.db import get_supabase_client

supabase = get_supabase_client()
ml_predictor = get_ml_url_predictor(supabase)

# Train with current data
success = ml_predictor.train_model(retrain=True)
print(f"Training {'successful' if success else 'failed'}")
```

#### 3. Automatic Training

The model automatically trains during extraction when:
- Model is not currently trained
- Sufficient training data exists (‚â•10 URLs)
- Enhanced URL Manager is initialized

## Integration with Pipeline

### Enhanced URL Manager Flow

```python
# 1. Get extraction context
context = url_manager.get_extraction_context(parish_id, base_url)

# 2. Get ML-optimized URL candidates
candidates = url_manager.get_optimized_url_candidates(context, discovered_urls)

# Priority order:
# - ML Predictions (20.0 * confidence boost)
# - Golden URLs (15.0 boost)
# - Smart Discovery (5.0 boost)
# - Standard URLs (base priority)
```

### Automatic Learning Loop

```python
# During extraction
with VisitTracker(url, parish_id, visit_tracker) as visit_result:
    # 1. Make HTTP request
    # 2. Assess content quality
    # 3. Record extraction success/failure
    # 4. Store visit data for ML training

    # Data automatically available for next training cycle
```

## Best Practices

### Training Schedule

- **Initial Training**: After collecting 50+ URLs from extractions
- **Regular Retraining**: Weekly or monthly with fresh data
- **Performance Monitoring**: Check accuracy and prediction confidence
- **Data Quality**: Ensure balanced positive/negative examples

### Monitoring

```bash
# Check training data availability
python train_ml_model.py --verbose

# Monitor prediction performance
grep "üß†.*predicted" logs/extraction.log

# Review success rates
grep "üîç.*Visit tracked" logs/extraction.log
```

### Optimization Tips

1. **Collect Quality Data**: Run extractions on diverse parishes
2. **Balance Training Set**: Ensure mix of successful and failed URLs
3. **Regular Retraining**: Update model with fresh patterns monthly
4. **Monitor Drift**: Watch for declining prediction accuracy over time
5. **Domain Diversity**: Train on various diocese websites and CMS types

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Low Prediction Accuracy (<85%)
- **Cause**: Insufficient or imbalanced training data
- **Solution**: Run more extractions, ensure diverse parish websites

#### No ML Predictions Generated
- **Cause**: Model failed to train or initialize
- **Solution**: Check logs, verify scikit-learn installation, retrain manually

#### Very Low Confidence Scores (<0.2)
